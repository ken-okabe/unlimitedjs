== What is virtual DOM?

[source,js]
.virtual DOM
----
const helloNode = <div>Hello!</div>;
----

This is a virtual DOM written in JSX(JavaScript XML).

https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html[Introducing JSX]

JSX  is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure UI in JavaScript.

The significant feature here is we can treat DOM as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen[first class object] in JavaScript like any other values. This allows us efficient coding to build JavaScript UI, in theory.

Since virtual DOM became a member of first class objects in JavaScript, we should be able to handle virtual DOM as input/output of functions like any other values in functional programming.


== Transpile from JSX to JS

Although JSX is useful, as it's an extension to the vanilla JavaScript syntax, we need to transpile to JS.

We can use https://babeljs.io/[Babel] or https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] as a transpiler. JSX of unlimitedjs(superfine) works on both.

After the transpile, we will get the code like this:

[source,js]
.hyperscript
---- 
const helloNode = h("div", null, "Hello!");
----

This is called hyperscript syntax commonly used, and we need to prepare a function `h`.

[source,js]
.import h from superfine
----
import { h } from "superfine";
const helloNode = h("div", null, "Hello!");
----

**One of the major role of superfine is to provide `h` that is an essential element of JSX/hyperscript.**

== Render the view

1. Every time something needs to be updated in our application view, we create a new virtual DOM using `h` (which is hidden in JSX).

2. Then by comparing the old and new virtual DOM, we can update the difference of the DOM that actually changed instead of rendering the entire DOM from scratch. `patch` API of superfine preforms this task. 

[source,js]
.patch
----
patch(container, newNode);
----

**Providing `patch` functionality is another major role of superfine.**

Most importantly, for superfine library in virtual DOM aspect, `patch` **is the only API we need to learn.**

`h` is hidden in JSX, so we can forget. (To be precise, there are more extra APIs in superfine, but it's not critical to use.) 

So, if we want to render `helloNode`, the code should be as follows:


[source,js]
.render the view
----
import { h, patch } from "superfine";

const helloNode = <div>Hello!</div>;  <1>

const lastNode = patch( <2>
      document.getElementById("app"),  <3>
      helloNode  <4> 
    );
----

<1> virtual DOM node
<2> The only API `patch` returns next "last" node.
<3> Real DOM Container to render the virtual DOM
<4> next (new) virtual DOM node

Although we need to import `{ h, patch }`, `h` will never appear in the code as long as we use JSX.
